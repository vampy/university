1. Library

A library offers its subscriber books that can be borrowed. The library has many terminals where the subscribers can borrow books. In order to use the  terminal, the subscriber must introduce his/her library ID.

 After a successful identification, the subscriber sees all the available books and may borrow one or more books (no more than three).  After the loan is completed, all the other subscribers using the terminals see the updated list of available books.

The subscriber can also search for a book, by typing a substring from the title. The terminal will display all the books from the library containing that substring together with their status (borrowed or available).



For returning books there is only one terminal. In order to return a book the subscriber introduces his/her library ID and the book ID. After a successful return the list of available books is automatically updated.
