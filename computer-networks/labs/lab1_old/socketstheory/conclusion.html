>Well, that's the lot of it.  Hopefully at least some of the
information contained within this document has been remotely accurate

accountable.  See, I don't stand behind a single word of this document,
legally speaking.  The whole thing could be completely and utterly
wrong!</P

>But it's probably not.  After all, I've spent many many hours
messing with this stuff, and implemented several TCP/IP network
utilities at work, have written multiplayer game engines, and so on.
But I'm not the sockets god; I'm just some guy.</P

>In case you're wondering why I did this, well, I did it for the
money.  Ha!  No, really, I did it because a lot of people have asked me
socket-related questions and when I tell them I've been thinking about
putting together a socket page, they say, "Cool!"  Besides, I feel that
all this hard-earned knowledge is going to waste if I can't share it
with others.  The web just happens to be the perfect vehicle.  I
encourage others to provide similar information whenever
possible.</P
