>Blocking.  You've heard about it--now what the heck is it?  In a
nutshell, "block" is techie jargon for "sleep".  You probably noticed
that when you run <B
CLASS="command"
>listener</B
>, above, it just sits there
until a packet arrives.  What happened is that it called
<TT
CLASS="function"
>recvfrom()</TT
>, there was no data, and so
<TT
CLASS="function"
>recvfrom()</TT
> is said to "block" (that is, sleep
there) until some data arrives.</P
><P
>Lots of functions block.  <TT
CLASS="function"
>accept()</TT
> blocks.
All the <TT
CLASS="function"
>recv()</TT
> functions block.  The reason they
can do this is because they're allowed to.  When you first create the
socket descriptor with <TT
CLASS="function"
>socket()</TT
>, the kernel sets it
to blocking.  If you don't want a socket to be blocking, you have to
make a call to <TT
CLASS="function"
>fcntl()</TT

If you put your program in a busy-wait looking for data on the socket,
you'll suck up CPU time like it was going out of style.  A more elegant
solution for checking to see if there's data waiting to be read comes in
the following section on <TT

Well, sometimes you don't want to wait forever for someone to send you
some data.  Maybe every 96 seconds you want to print "Still Going..." to
the terminal even though nothing has happened.  This time structure
allows you to specify a timeout period.  If the time is exceeded and
<TT
CLASS="function"
>select()</TT
> still hasn't found any ready file
descriptors, it'll return so you can continue processing.</P
><P
>The <TT
CLASS="type"
>struct timeval</TT

>&#13;    struct timeval {

        int tv_usec;    // microseconds
    }; 
</PRE
></TD
></TR
></TABLE
><P
>Just set <TT
CLASS="parameter"
><I
>tv_sec</I
></TT
> to the number of seconds to
wait, and set <TT
CLASS="parameter"
><I
>tv_usec</I
></TT
> to the number of
microseconds to wait.  Yes, that's <EM
>micro</EM
>seconds,
not milliseconds.  There are 1,000 microseconds in a millisecond, and
1,000 milliseconds in a second.  Thus, there are 1,000,000 microseconds
in a second.  Why is it "usec"?  The "u" is supposed to look like the
Greek letter μ (Mu) that we use for "micro".  Also, when the function
returns, <TT
CLASS="parameter"
><I
>timeout</I
></TT
> <EM
>might</EM
> be
updated to show the time still remaining.  This depends on what flavor
of Unix you're running.</P
><P
>Yay!  We have a microsecond resolution timer!  Well, don't count
on it.  Standard Unix timeslice is around 100 milliseconds, so you might
have to wait that long no matter how small you set your <TT
CLASS="type"
>struct
timeval</TT
>.</P
><P
>Other things of interest:  If you set the fields in your
<TT
CLASS="type"
>struct timeval</TT
> to <TT
CLASS="constant"
>0</TT
>,
<TT
CLASS="function"
>select()</TT
> will timeout immediately, effectively
polling all the file descriptors in your sets.  If you set the
parameter <TT
CLASS="parameter"
><I
>timeout</I
></TT
> to NULL, it will never timeout,
and will wait until the first file descriptor is ready.  Finally, if you
don't care about waiting for a certain set, you can just set it to NULL
in the call to <TT
CLASS="function"
>select()</TT
>.</P

><P

pending, and I <TT

is ready to read, and <TT

<TT

data that represents whatever you feel is necessary to complete your

HREF="advanced.html#sendall"

don't want to <TT

say "Hi".</P

unpack (sometimes referred to as "marshal" and "unmarshal") this data.

communicate!</P

characters, padded with <TT

assume the data is variable length, up to a maximum of 128
characters.  Let's have a look a sample packet structure that we might
use in this situation:</P

><OL
TYPE="1"
><LI
><P
><TT
CLASS="computeroutput"

-- The total length of the packet, counting the 8-byte user name and
chat data.</P
></LI
><LI

><TT
CLASS="computeroutput"
>name</TT
> (8 bytes) -- The
user's name, NUL-padded if necessary.</P
></LI
><LI
><P
><TT
CLASS="computeroutput"
>chatdata</TT
>
(<EM
>n</EM
>-bytes) -- The data itself, no more than 128
bytes.  The length of the packet should be calculated as the length of
this data plus 8 (the length of the name field,
above).</P
></LI
></OL
><P
>Why did I choose the 8-byte and 128-byte limits for the fields?  I
pulled them out of the air, assuming they'd be long enough.  Maybe,
though, 8 bytes is too restrictive for your needs, and you can have a
30-byte name field, or whatever.  The choice is up to you.</P

>(The length is stored in Network Byte Order, of course.  In this
case, it's only one byte so it doesn't matter, but generally speaking
you'll want all your binary integers to be stored in Network Byte Order
in your packets.)</P

>When you're sending this data, you should be safe and use a
command similar to <A
HREF="advanced.html#sendall"

know all the data is sent, even if it takes multiple calls to

>Likewise, when you're receiving this data, you need to do a bit of extra
work.  To be safe, you should assume that you might receive a partial
packet (like maybe we receive "<TT
CLASS="computeroutput"
>00 14 42 65
6E</TT
>" from Benjamin, above, but that's all we get in this
call to <TT
CLASS="function"
>recv()</TT

<TT
CLASS="function"
>recv()</TT
> over and over again until the packet is
completely received.</P
><P
>But how?  Well, we know the number of bytes we need to receive in
total for the packet to be complete, since that number is tacked on the
front of the packet.  We also know the maximum packet size is 1+8+128,
or 137 bytes (because that's how we defined the packet.)</P
><P
>What you can do is declare an array big enough for two packets.
This is your work array where you will reconstruct packets as they
arrive.</P
><P
>Every time you <TT
CLASS="function"
>recv()</TT
> data, you'll feed it
into the work buffer and check to see if the packet is complete.  That
is, the number of bytes in the buffer is greater than or equal to the
length specified in the header (+1, because the length in the header
doesn't include the byte for the length itself.)  If the number of bytes
in the buffer is less than 1, the packet is not complete, obviously.
You have to make a special case for this, though, since the first byte
is garbage and you can't rely on it for the correct packet
length.</P
><P
>Once the packet is complete, you can do with it what you
will.  Use it, and remove it from your work buffer.</P
><P
>Whew!  Are you juggling that in your head yet?  Well, here's the
second of the one-two punch: you might have read past the end of one
packet and onto the next in a single <TT
CLASS="function"
>recv()</TT
> call.
That is, you have a work buffer with one complete packet, and an
incomplete part of the next packet!  Bloody heck.  (But this is why you
made your work buffer large enough to hold <EM
>two</EM
>
packets--in case this happened!)</P
><P
>Since you know the length of the first packet from the header, and
you've been keeping track of the number of bytes in the work buffer, you
can subtract and calculate how many of the bytes in the work buffer
belong to the second (incomplete) packet.  When you've handled the first
one, you can clear it out of the work buffer and move the partial second
packed down the to front of the buffer so it's all ready to go for the
next <TT
CLASS="function"
>recv()</TT
>.</P
><P
>(Some of you readers will note that actually moving the partial
second packet to the beginning of the work buffer takes time, and the
program can be coded to not require this by using a circular buffer.
Unfortunately for the rest of you, a discussion on circular buffers is
beyond the scope of this article.  If you're still curious, grab a data
structures book and go from there.)</P
