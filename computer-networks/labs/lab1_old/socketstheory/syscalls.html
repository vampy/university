a long time ago, it was thought that maybe a address family (what the
"AF" in "<TT

protocols that were referenced by their protocol family (what the "PF" in
"<TT

in your <TT

All ports below 1024 are RESERVED (unless you're the superuser)!  You
can have any port number above that, right up to 65535 (provided they

What does that mean?  Well, a bit a of socket that was connected is
still hanging around in the kernel, and it's hogging the port.  You can
either wait for it to clear (a minute or so), or add code to your
program allowing it to reuse the port, like this:</P
