></H1
><P
>You hear talk of "sockets" all the time, and perhaps you are
wondering just what they are exactly.  Well, they're this: a way to
speak to other programs using standard Unix file descriptors.</P
><P
>What?</P
><P
>Ok--you may have heard some Unix hacker state, "Jeez,
<EM
>everything</EM
> in Unix is a file!"  What that person
may have been talking about is the fact that when Unix programs do any
sort of I/O, they do it by reading or writing to a file descriptor.  A
file descriptor is simply an integer associated with an open file.  But
(and here's the catch), that file can be a network connection, a FIFO, a
pipe, a terminal, a real on-the-disk file, or just about anything else.
Everything in Unix <EM
>is</EM
> a file!  So when you want to
communicate with another program over the Internet you're gonna do it
through a file descriptor, you'd better believe it.</P
><P
>"Where do I get this file descriptor for network communication,
Mr.  Smarty-Pants?" is probably the last question on your mind right
now, but I'm going to answer it anyway: You make a call to the
<TT
CLASS="function"
>socket()</TT
> system routine.  It returns the socket
descriptor, and you communicate through it using the specialized
<TT
CLASS="function"
>send()</TT
> and <TT
CLASS="function"
>recv()</TT
>
(<B

><A
HREF="http://linux.com.hk/man/showman.cgi?manpath=/man/man2/recv.2.inc"
TARGET="_top"
>man recv</A
></B
>) socket
calls.</P
><P
>"But, hey!" you might be exclaiming right about now.  "If it's a
file descriptor, why in the name of Neptune can't I just use the normal
<TT
CLASS="function"
>read()</TT
> and <TT
CLASS="function"
>write()</TT
> calls to
communicate through the socket?"  The short answer is, "You can!"  The
longer answer is, "You can, but <TT
CLASS="function"
>send()</TT
> and
<TT
CLASS="function"
>recv()</TT
> offer much greater control over your data
transmission."</P
><P
>What next?  How about this: there are all kinds of sockets.  There
are DARPA Internet addresses (Internet Sockets), path names on a local
node (Unix Sockets), CCITT X.25 addresses (X.25 Sockets that you can
safely ignore), and probably many others depending on which Unix flavor
you run.  This document deals only with the first: Internet
Sockets.</P

NAME="twotypes"
>2.1. Two Types of Internet Sockets</A
></H2
><P
>What's this?  There are two types of Internet sockets?  Yes.
Well, no.  I'm lying.  There are more, but I didn't want to scare you.
I'm only going to talk about two types here.  Except for this sentence,
where I'm going to tell you that "Raw Sockets" are also very powerful
and you should look them up.</P
><P
>All right, already.  What are the two types?  One is "Stream
Sockets"; the other is "Datagram Sockets", which may hereafter be
referred to as "<TT
CLASS="constant"
>SOCK_STREAM</TT
>" and
"<TT
CLASS="constant"
>SOCK_DGRAM</TT
>", respectively.  Datagram sockets are
sometimes called "connectionless sockets".  (Though they can be
<TT
CLASS="function"
>connect()</TT
>'d if you really want.  See <A
HREF="syscalls.html#connect"
><TT
CLASS="function"
>connect()</TT
></A
>, below.)</P
><P
>Stream sockets are reliable two-way connected communication
streams.  If you output two items into the socket in the order "1, 2",
they will arrive in the order "1, 2" at the opposite end.  They will
also be error free.  Any errors you do encounter are figments of your
own deranged mind, and are not to be discussed here.</P
><P
>What uses stream sockets?  Well, you may have heard of the
<B
CLASS="command"
>telnet</B
> application, yes?  It uses stream sockets.
All the characters you type need to arrive in the same order you type
them, right?  Also, web browsers use the HTTP protocol which uses stream
sockets to get pages.  Indeed, if you telnet to a web site on port 80,
and type "<TT
CLASS="computeroutput"
>GET /</TT
>", it'll dump the HTML
back at you!</P
><P
>How do stream sockets achieve this high level of data transmission
quality?  They use a protocol called "The Transmission Control
Protocol", otherwise known as "TCP" (see <A
HREF="http://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc793.txt"
TARGET="_top"
>RFC-793</A
> for extremely detailed info
on TCP.)  TCP makes sure your data arrives sequentially and error-free.
You may have heard "TCP" before as the better half of "TCP/IP" where
"IP" stands for "Internet Protocol" (see <A
HREF="http://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc791.txt"
TARGET="_top"
>RFC-791</A
>.)  IP deals primarily with
Internet routing and is not generally responsible for data
integrity.</P
><P
>Cool.  What about Datagram sockets?  Why are they called
connectionless?  What is the deal, here, anyway?  Why are they
unreliable?  Well, here are some facts: if you send a datagram, it may
arrive.  It may arrive out of order.  If it arrives, the data within the
packet will be error-free.</P
><P
>Datagram sockets also use IP for routing, but they don't use TCP;
they use the "User Datagram Protocol", or "UDP" (see <A
HREF="http://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc768.txt"
TARGET="_top"
>RFC-768</A
>.)</P
><P
>Why are they connectionless?  Well, basically, it's because you
don't have to maintain an open connection as you do with stream sockets.
You just build a packet, slap an IP header on it with destination
information, and send it out.  No connection needed.  They are generally
used for packet-by-packet transfers of information.  Sample
applications: <B
CLASS="command"
>tftp</B
>, <B
CLASS="command"
>bootp</B
>,
etc.</P
><P
>"Enough!" you may scream. "How do these programs even work if
datagrams might get lost?!"  Well, my human friend, each has it's own
protocol on top of UDP.  For example, the tftp protocol says that for
each packet that gets sent, the recipient has to send back a packet that
says, "I got it!" (an "ACK" packet.)  If the sender of the original
packet gets no reply in, say, five seconds, he'll re-transmit the packet
until he finally gets an ACK.  This acknowledgment procedure is very
important when implementing <TT
CLASS="constant"
>SOCK_DGRAM</TT
>
applications.</P

Basically, it says this: a packet is born, the packet is wrapped
("encapsulated") in a header (and rarely a footer) by the first protocol
(say, the TFTP protocol), then the whole thing (TFTP header included) is
encapsulated again by the next protocol (say, UDP), then again by the
next (IP), then again by the final protocol on the hardware (physical)
layer (say, Ethernet).</P
><P
>When another computer receives the packet, the hardware strips the
Ethernet header, the kernel strips the IP and UDP headers, the TFTP
program strips the TFTP header, and it finally has the data.</P
><P
>Now I can finally talk about the infamous <EM
>Layered
Network Model</EM
>.  This Network Model describes a system of
network functionality that has many advantages over other models.  For
instance, you can write sockets programs that are exactly the same
without caring how the data is physically transmitted (serial, thin
Ethernet, AUI, whatever) because programs on lower levels deal with it
for you.  The actual network hardware and topology is transparent to the
socket programmer.</P
><P
>Without any further ado, I'll present the layers of the full-blown
model.  Remember this for network class exams:</P
><P
>&#13;<P
></P
><UL
><LI
><P
>Application</P
></LI
><LI
><P
>Presentation</P
></LI
><LI
><P
>Session</P
></LI
><LI
><P
>Transport</P
></LI
><LI
><P
>Network</P
></LI
><LI
><P
>Data Link</P
></LI
><LI
><P
>Physical</P
></LI
></UL
>
</P
><P
>The Physical Layer is the hardware (serial, Ethernet, etc.).  The
Application  Layer is just about as far from the physical layer as you
can imagine--it's the place where users interact with the
network.</P
><P
>Now, this model is so general you could probably use it as an
automobile repair guide if you really wanted to.  A layered model more
consistent with Unix might be:</P
><P
>&#13;<P
></P
><UL
><LI
><P
>Application Layer (<EM
>telnet, ftp,
etc.</EM
>)</P
></LI
><LI
><P
>Host-to-Host Transport Layer (<EM
>TCP,
UDP</EM
>)</P
></LI
><LI
><P
>Internet Layer (<EM
>IP and
routing</EM
>)</P
></LI
><LI
><P
>Network Access Layer (<EM
>Ethernet, ATM, or
whatever</EM
>)</P
></LI
></UL
>
</P
><P
>At this point in time, you can probably see how these layers
correspond to the encapsulation of the original data.</P
><P
>See how much work there is in building a simple packet?  Jeez!
And you have to type in the packet headers yourself using
"<B
CLASS="command"
>cat</B
>"!  Just kidding.  All you have to do for stream
sockets is <TT
CLASS="function"
>send()</TT
> the data out.  All you have to do
for datagram sockets is encapsulate the packet in the method of your
choosing and <TT
CLASS="function"
>sendto()</TT
> it out.  The kernel builds
the Transport Layer and Internet Layer on for you and the hardware does
the Network Access Layer.  Ah, modern technology.</P
><P
>So ends our brief foray into network theory.  Oh yes, I forgot to
tell you everything I wanted to say about routing: nothing!  That's
right, I'm not going to talk about it at all.  The router strips the
packet to the IP header, consults its routing table, blah blah blah.
